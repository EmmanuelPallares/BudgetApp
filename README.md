Hello welcome, I have created an app with react using the bootstrap, uuid and react icons libraries that can be very useful, it serves to create a list of expenses.
The user can edit the total budget and the remaining amount and the accumulated amount will automatically appear.

For this, the same user adds the name and the amount of the expense to the interface and is added to the list, the user can eliminate the expense from the list if they so decide.

When a new expense is added to the list, the tables of the remaining balance and the accumulated amount are automatically updated.
